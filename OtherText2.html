						&emsp; It happens so often that a plethora of local romance book readers claim a trope or several tropes to be superior; but when asked for the reasoning behind the claim, they shrug their shoulders. If such a claim is made, there should be reasoning for it whether how enjoyable a romance book was or how the book made them feel. Stephanie Bohrer is quite the opposite with her video about ranking every romance book trope. She did an amazing job at justifying how enjoyable or unenjoyable it was in her experience to read the twenty-nine tropes she produced. She categorized them into five different tiers: the highest being &ldquo;GOD TIER,&rdquo; which is reserved for her all-time favorite tropes to the lowest being &ldquo;avoid&rdquo; (she reveals her final ranking at 13:52). <br><br>
						&emsp; Coincidentally, her all-time favorite romance tropes are the most discussed and promoted on BookTok and Bookstagram. Most of those tropes, if not all, share the common trait of having built-up tension, chemistry, or intensity, between a couple, which is waiting to break or see who &ldquo;falls&rdquo; first. Something I found interesting about the tropes that Bohrer ranked in the bottom two tiers is that they demonstrate some form of power dynamic that suggests a negative or toxic connotation in the relationship; this goes against her wanting to read romance books to see the couple be together. Overall, what I appreciated the most about Bohrerâ€™s ranking is that she supported her stances on which trope goes where based on her reading experience. She not only gave examples of a scenario she enjoyed reading about or disliked; she also provided names of specific books. She even implied that she has love-hate relationships with some tropes, and it really depends on the book she read.
