						&emsp; Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) falls for the handsome Mark King after having her fair share of failed romantic relationships. When she pays a surprise visit to his home in Connecticut, she is the one surprised instead when she learns that Mark is married to his loyal stay-at-home spouse Kate (Leslie Mann). As Carly and Kate bond over their anger about Mark, they discover a third woman (Kate Upton) in the mix. Together, fed up with Mark’s antiques and lies, they join forces to seek revenge. <br><br>
						&emsp; <i>The Other Woman</i> (2014) samples the love-triangle trope. A reader would normally expect one love triangle; there are multiple in this film, to say the least. Love triangles often show the protagonist conflicted between two love interests and in the end, they choose to be with one of the love interests and break the other’s heart. <i>The Other Woman</i>’s ending strays far from the predictable ending and creates a more engaging twist. The man at the center of this love &ldquo;square&rdquo; does not get the opportunity to choose who he gets to be with because the women do that for themselves; They choose themselves and each other by realizing they deserve more than someone who will not remain faithful to them and work together to assert revenge on him. This is a refreshing take on the trope because for one, the cheating man does not win and two, women are collaborating rather than pitting themselves against each other for the actions of an unfaithful man. The ending reveals that the three women remain friends and receive their own happy endings. The movie also highlights how crucial gender representation is in film (learn more about gender representation <u><a href="https://cpslo-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/athai09_calpoly_edu/ETgxvQf_1KNIpb9ImDdLu2MBUGlKejk62VWjLbRqakb_Lw?e=uAurTd">here</a></u>). What is demonstrated on the screen can either negatively or positively affect how women are treated in parallel real-life scenarios. As the <i>Women’s Museum</i> states, &ldquo;It is essential to display female characters that are heroes of their own stories.&rdquo;
